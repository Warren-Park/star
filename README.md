# Star
- Auxiliary data for 'Finding the possible positions of undiscovered stars by using a machine learning method'.
- .csv files have three columns. From the left, each column represents RA, Dec, and distance in pc from the sun respectively.
- .fig files require MATLAB software installed to be opened.
- Plotter application works automatically when you launch the app by using a python launcher, but requires MATLAB Python API package installed.
- Each file name follows the rule: x-y, z-k, q-l where x represents minimum RA, y for maximum RA, z for minimum Dec, k for maximum Dec, q for minimum distance, and l for the maximum distance for the search range inputted when generating the random numbers.
- Use plotter_without_matlab in case you do not have MATLAB installed on your computer. The plotter application still requires matplotlib to be installed.
- Plotter applications are in Data folder.
- When you type the name of the file in the plotter, please omit the file extensions.
